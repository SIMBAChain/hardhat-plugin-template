# hardhat-plugin-template
This repo is a template/boilerplate for a project that uses the SIMBA Hardhat plugin

Users would overwrite this README with their own user instructions once they have created a project using this template.

## Using this template repo
You can use this template for your project by navigating to the main page for this repo, and clicking the "Use this template" link. Project main page is located at:

## .gitignore
Note that some directories/files that are listed in .gitignore are present in this project structure. That is just so users have a full understanding of the relevant project structure, and can use this boilerplate. A user should ALWAYS make sure that **authconfig.json and **.env are present in their .gitignore file, since these are files that will contain secrets.
